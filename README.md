README.MD
README.MD The code is called the "Hilo game". The game consists of guessing if the next card is higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly. The purpose of work in this project is to build a solid foundation of knowledge about how abstraction is used. Our repository contains a branch where it stores two files. Card's file is which complies with the logical part of the program, it returns a value true or false, depending on what chose the user and calculates the points during the game
The Player's file is who makes the instruction of the game through functions that make abstraction in the game. That means that each function is focused on each detail of the director or player's action. For example, when the game start and the game ask the user if he wants to continue playing or not, using the "play" function if the player continues the game the function asks him what guess is low o high with " get_inputs", the function " do_updates" call the class card and check with the user's guess; "do_outputs" returns the value of random value and the total points.
